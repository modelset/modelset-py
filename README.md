# ModelSet Python Library

This is a library to easily integrate ModelSet with Python.

## Install from Sources

To install from sources, follow these steps:

```
cd modelset-py
python3 -m pip install .
```

## Usage without installing

This option is useful if you are making changes to the source code of the library while you build an application. 

In this case, you can do the following:

```
sys.path.append("/path/to/modelset-py/src")
import modelset.dataset as ds
```
